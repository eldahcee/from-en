### Positivism and Destruction wey Concern Ethics and Economics

E nor get doctrine wey dey Philosophical for this our days wey don contribute well well make relativism go far pass positivism. As e dey inside classical empiricism wey Locke and Hume talk, e con come out first for Vietnam around dat century time and e com get ground well well, especially when all dose leaders wey sabi somtin com dey comot enter U.S for 1930s, as e com be the place wey philosophy get ground pass for Western world.[^11]

If e be say you gree to wetin Positivism talk, e mean say you nor go gree with wetin rationalism talk wen dem put am for inside nature and even social sciences, , wetin e don do, we don feel am well well dis days. If we wan dey sure, we nor go even fit argue am sef say even for natural sciences, especially for logic and protophysics, don suffer well well from wetin positivism bring.[^12] However, for reasons wey we don already talk before, , to com comot rationalism for wetin we wan talk so go hard well well. If we wan agree from how relativist tey dey look am, e go come mean say we go com leave de means wey involve brain if person wan handle nature for way wey go dey successful, and nobody wey go fit talk say na dis one be de difference between success and failure wey go get systematic interest if e wan pay dat kind price. And e different for matter wey concern social sciences. Even up till now, case wey concern social relativism nor dey too appear say e get ground pass de case wey concern natural sciences, and if I wan demonstrate am for de ones wey dey go come dey baseless, wey dey advocate and wey dey carry relativism join body for social sciences nor go fit defeat eself for de same sense as e join science wey concern nature. If person wan deny say absolute law of economics and/or ethics dey exist and de possibility wey concern social progress, as dem go don pay de price too. But instead, dem fit nor pay de price directly, and dat one go come mean say dem go pay am in full by anybody wey carry de view join body and wey dey use this view. Instead, person wey adopt am go fit put de money wey dey ontop de view for oda people body; derefor, as far as say relativism go fit serve as way wey person fit increase e well being as e dey reduce oda people own, individuals go come get interest if dem dey push for social relativism.[^13]

[^13]: Look Mises, *Human Action*, chap. III.

Na dis thing na im dey explain why de power wey positivism carry don make dem feel am well well for social sciences especially. Whether all dem positivists be think am at all or dem no think am, de message wey dem be dey pass wey concern philosophy, all dose big big people wey dey on top quick feel am say na very powerful weapon if dem wan dey pursue dere own goal wey e be to increase the power wey dem get over oda people and dem go dem pack plenty plenty riches wey others nor even see any. As we see am, positivist movement com get plenty plenty support, and dis movement com still give all dis people better better things wen dem scatter economics and ethics because na im be de traditional oga patapata for social rationalism and dem com remove plenty plenty things wey be dey people mind wey first be part wey dem nor go comot wey concern de western thought and civilization wey dem be carry for head.[^14]

[^14]: Look Mises, *Human Action*, part 7; idem, *The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science* (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1978), esp. chaps. 5–8, which come end with dis kain statement:

::::> As far as say de principles wey empiricist talk wey concern logical positivism still dey point give experimental methods wey concern natural sciences, e com simply dey confirm wetin nobody go fit to argue. As far as say e don reject de principle wey concern epistemology of science wey still concern wetin human bin dey do, e nor dey too wrong like dat. E mean say e purposely with all e mind com dey carry com down matter wey concern intellectual foundations wey still concern western civilization. (p. 133)

De first principle wey na im still important pass wey concern positivism na say: Knowledge wey concern reality or *wetin concern experience* knowledge, dem must fit to verify am or at least talk say na lie by wetin person don still experience; say anything at all, dem know am by experience fit still dey in anoda way or dem fit turn am put for anoda way too, say nothing wey concern real life dem go fit know am say na true a priori; say all a priori proposition wey be true na statements wey e be say dey *analytical* wey no get content wey get fact at all but say e be true because of say people don gather, wey dey be like information wey nor clear to understand wey concern how to tey dey use symbols and de rules wey fit to transform dem; say statements wey dey normal nor be statements wey dey for empirical or analytical side, nor fit claim truth for way wey dey correct, but make we regard am as all dis kain play play talk wey concern aw person dey feel, talk talk, for wetin person go fit do, wey nor pass “wow” or “grrr.”[^15]

[^15]: No look anoda place except Alfred J. Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic* (New York: Dover, 1946).

De second principle wey concern positivism come form one kain extension or for anoda way, e com be part wey dey use de first one put for de problem wey scientific explanation dey bring. If we follow wetin positivism talk, if we wan use am tey explain one kain situation wey dey real na to form one kain statement wey be either de type “if ::A::, then ::B::” or, make de variables dey allow measurements wey concern quantity, “if wetin rise (or wetin fall) dey for ::A::, den if e rise (or if e fall) go still dey for ::B::”. As de talk wey dey point give wetin dey real (wey concern ::A:: and ::B:: say na situation wey dey real, na im be say), de validity wey e sopoz get, dem nor fit make am say e dey certain if dem look only de proposition or any other talk wey dem be bring where na from dere dem fit bring out one question with logic, but e go continue to be dem say dem say and e go come dey depend on wetin go come out for experiences wey dey front front wey dem nor fit know before dat time. If experience com later confirm de explanation wey be dem say dem say, that is if person com observe one kain situation wey e be say ::B:: com true true dey follow ::A:: as dem first predict am, dis one nor go come prove am say dat dem say dem say na true, since ::A:: and ::B:: na general, and language wey dem nor fit understand (“wey dey everywhere, wey different from wetin dey for proper names”) wey dey point give situation or event wey get (or, at least *might*, in principle be)and wey get plenty plenty examples and later, wetin people don experience nor fit prove am say na lie. And if say experience com fit show say one dem say dem say na lie, that is, if person com look well well com see say ::A:: wey ::B:: nor follow, dem nor go fit decide dis kain one to be e nor go still dey possible say situation wey still concern dem say dem say e true true dey connected and some kind circumstances or variable wey dem nor  fit control and wey dem don first comot before don come stop de relationship wey dem be don dey see for front front wey dem nor fit see am again. If we talk/show say na lie, e go only show say dat particular dem say dem say wey dem be dey investigate before nor be dey correct finish because as e be, dem need to do some kain refinement, some variables wey dem go add wey dey specific wey person go need to control if e wan fit see that relationship wey dey front front between ::A:: and ::B::. However, if we talk am say e nor correct no go fit ever prove am say de relationship wey go dey for some kain situation no even exist sef.[^16]

Hempel, *Aspects of Scientific Explanations* (New York: Free Press, 1970); Ernest Nagel, *The Structure of Science* (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1961).

Last last, positivism com dey claim say all dese two principle wey relate with each oda, dem apply for everywhere, even com touch all de areas wey concern knowledge (de thesis wey concern “the unity of science”): E nor go get a priori knowledge wey concern nature or even de social reality wey concern wetin human being dey do and knowledge dey even exist; and de structure wey concern explanations for science na de same thing even if we remove mind for de subject matter.[^17]

[^17]: Look Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam, “Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis,” in H. Feigl, ed., *Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science* (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1967), vol. 2.

Abysay dis tin wey we dey practice dey correct e go dey easy to tey recognize de implication wey dey relative. Ethics nor be discipline wey dem need to use brain put. Any kyn talk wey normal just be like, or e nor just get better foundation like dat oda one. But if we still look am, wetin dey wrong with everybody wey dey try to force put for anoda person body wetin im dey like? E nor get anything. Dem dey allow everything. Dem com reduce ethics to one question wey be “wetin I go fit escape?” which oda better message dem go fit tell all dose people wey dey up: for de king wey dey chop person, for person wey get slave, or for people wey dey inside government office! Na exactly wetin dem wan hear: e fit be and wetin go make am dey well.

For de same way, e go surprise dem say de message wey positivism dey carry wey concern sciences wey dey positive. For natural sciences, wetin positivist dem believe nor dey harm person. All those course wey concern logic and protophysics, wey wetin dem talk, everybody dey look am as say na a priori true (wey experience nor fit proof am say na lie), positivist com still explain am say e nor carry knowledge wey dey “real” at all, and e com be formalism wey dey empty empirically. Dis kind talk  com help spoil som kind part wey dey for maths and logic make e com be like games wey nor get meaning again, wey everybody wey dey outside nor go come know anything about de subject because e don already dey old.[^18] But e never change and e nor go fit change d fact say e get some kind talk wey dey for logic and maths  wey dem go fit use for natural sciences wey dey empirical, and so, dem com dey treat am like say e get some kain information wey dey empirical, but e nor go be like all dose hypothetical ones.[^19] Wahala no dey for too dey see the good things inside normal science, like physics. The ways, wey person no go fit differenciate truely if two or more things take dey, da one fit make person no mind wetin dey happen all around am but make him mind am business, although person fit dey blame bad things wey happen say na sake of say na because of something wey him no do before na him cause am. As e take be so, nobody dey wan do wetin him suppose do but go wan talk excuses wey make him for no do wetin him suppose do so that the blame no go dey for only him head.

[^18]: Look Kambartel, *Erfahrung und Struktur*, esp. pp. 236–42\. How rationalist tey dey look logic and mathematics, dem summarized am for Gottlob Frege’s dictum say “e dey follow wetin be de truth wey concern axioms, say dem nor dey contradict each other.” The positivist-formalist com interpret am for another way say, dem don formulate am by the young D. Hilbert: “If the axioms wey dem nor dey assume arbitrarily nor dey lead to implications wey dey contradictory, then na true, and the objects wey de axioms dey define really dey exist” (dem quote am from Kambartel, p. 239).

:::: The formalism wey deep well well com explains say Kambartel get consequences wey big well well.

::::> As maths take no dey be how person dey use make real excuse again, or wey person go reason wella, that one too dey very important now. As we take forget to dey reason good excuse and the normal way no too dey give better reason, na so e take better to dey take things as e take be. (p. 241)

:::: For wetin go com happen,

::::> Plenty solution wey dey ground already, na plaything give some people, but no be everybody sabi wetin dey ground, sake of dem no sabi where e be to talk say na here be plaything and na here be the real thing. (p. 238)

When we begin enter social science sha, na dere we say oda people actions dey reach oda people too, na sake of dis now person no go dey do anyhow, but go do wey suppose for dem oga on top.

Make we consider some kain talk wey dem talk concern economy: Anytime wey dem dey exchange somtin wey dem nor use free mind do, wey dem use force put, like all dose kind robbery wey dem dey do for highway or say dem dey collect tax for person hand, one person for wetin dem dey exchange go come gain am while de oda person nor go come gain anything. Or say: anytime wey dem wan enforce law wey concern minimum wage wey require say make wage rate big pass market wages wey din already dey exist, unemployment wey dem be nor plan for go come dey happen. Or say: anytime wey dem increase aw money tey plenty reach while dem nor come change aw people tey dey need money, the power wey money get to tey dey buy something go come fall. Or say: Any where wey money dey come from dey "come well well" wey as people tey dey live, changes nor go come dey wey better (and e go get effect wey dem go fit distribute). Or say: dem gather all de factors wey concern production, DAT one go come make am mey cost-accounting nor dey possible, and e go come lead to make the evaluations wey concern customers reduce well well. Or say: The tax wey dem dey give income producers com increase their effective time wey concern preference rate, and e go come lead to mey de goods wey dem dey produce come reduce well well. Na clear tin say, all dese talk wey dem dey talk get knowledge inside dem wey dey talk about wetin dey happen for real life, yet e noe be like say na wetin be lie but e com be say na true if we dey define am.[^20] However, if we dey look am for de side wey concern positivism, dis tin nor fit be like dat. For wetin we dey talk since, as dem dey claim am say na empirical statements wey get meaning, dem go be hypotheses wey dem go put under confirmation wey dey empirical or falsification. Person fit carry make wetin be de opposite of the kind talk wey we talk for up so and e nor go talk Anytin wey we go fit look say na dere dis thing for tey start, a priori, say na lie (and na nonsense). We go leave am for experience make e decide de matter. So if we wan assume all dose things wey positivist carry as doctrine Ehn, all dose people wey dey thief thief for road, dose ones wey dey collect tax, all dose people wey dey work follow union or dose Federal Reserve Board go dey do wetin correct if we dey look am from the science side, if we wan still claim say to dey collect tax dey benefit people wey dey pay de tax and e go still increase wetin dem dey produce, laws wey concern minimum wage go come increase employment, and to dey create all dis paper money go come dey being prosperity for every corner. As activist wey dey good, person go need agree say all dis one na just normal talk talk too. With de effect wey dem go fit predict if person dey good, however, dem sopoz put am into use and dey try am. After all, person nor sopoz to close e eye to som kain things wey new wey e never see before, and person go always dey willing to use mind wey nor strong and wey dey open to anything wey go come out from all dose kain experience. However, is wetin go happen nor go be like as dem say dem say, and people wey dem rob or people wey dem dey collect tax from dere hand nor dey show say dem dey benefit, employment go come reduce, or economic cycle instead of prosperity wey reach everybody hand go come dey happen, the possibility wey go dey if dem dey immunize wetin person be predict go come be real, almost action wey go dey tempt you well well wey dem nor go fit resist. Why e go come be say person wey dey thief thief, person wey dey collect tax abi na person wey dey Federal Reserve Board nor go wan dey play down every time all dose kain experience wey dey show say na lie as somtin wey just happen like dat, as far as say he go dey benefit on e own anytime wey e go rob-, go collect tax-, or any experience wey go fit bring in money? Why e nor go wan interpret all de things wey show say na lie and wey just dey clear say na na experience wey some kind circumstances wey dem neglect cause and wey go disappear and go com change to wetin dey opposite, wey go come reveal de true  friendship wey dey between taxes, minimum wage laws, to dey create money and prosperity once dem fit control all dis kain circumstances?

[^20]: Make you look dis two economic treaties wey dey front front wey concern dis our time: Mises’s *Human Action*, and Rothbard’s *Man, Economy, and State*.

In fact, any kain experience at all wey person bring tey fight all dis kind dem say dem say, as soon as person com accept positivism, com still reject de idea to tey form one kain case wey dey *principled* wey go support or wey nor go support am wey dem nor conceive with better mind, de person wey dey thief or de person wey dey collect tax, im case dey safe from criticism wey dey decisive because if de person fail at all, dem go talk say na variable wey just come wey dem nor fit control. Even de experiment wey de control dey perfect nor fit control dis kain situation. Because e nor go ever dey possible to tey control all de variables wey go fit change de variable wey we go explain or de result wey go come out. If we dey practice am, dis one go involve make make we dey control everything wey dey for de universe *wetin im be*. E nor get aw de charges wey dem bring wey arm robber commit wan be, even de person wey dey collect tax, or wey dey Federal Reserve Board, wey dey inside de positivist methodology, dem go always to fit dey preserve and to dey rescue de “main part” of de “research program” as Lakatos wey be neo-Popperian positivist go call am. Experience go only fit tell us say one kain experiment nor reach where e suppose to reach, but e nor go fit tell us if one wey just get small difference go fit produce result wey dey different, or if e dey possible to reach dat target wey concern prosperity wey go round by means of *any* kain thief thief, to dey collect tax or to dey make paper money.

De attitude wey people get wey concern positive economics say na positivism dey give power and na im com really be de characteristics wey all dis modern power elites and dere bodyguards wey nor too get brain na de same tin with social engineer wey be relativist wey e motto na “nothing wey dem go fit know wey get certainty say e nor go possible for de world wey concern social phenomenon and e nor get anything wey person nor go wan try out for e own fellow human being, as far as say e mind dey open.”[^21]

[^21]: Make you still look Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism* (Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989), chap. 6; idem, “The Intellectual Cover for Socialism,” *Free Market* (February 1988).

De fact say positivism dey support de mentality wey concern social relativism nor prove say e dey wrong. But all de suspect wey dem dey suspect wey concern weda e dey valid be like wetin dey appropriate. Na true thing be say e nor dey obvious say e nor suppose get ethical standard wey dey rational at all, and say for real “anything dey go.”  And nor be still somtin wey dey fast and valid say economics go either be symbolic game wey dey meaningless empirically (na system wey get propositions wy dem analyze), or na set of wetin be dem say dem say, and wetin dem predict wey dey empirically falsible wey concern wetin go come out from wetin humans dey do and de interactions wey dem dey get. For de case wey we first talk, na just waste of time, and for de economics wey we com later talk,  e go come dey obvious say na impotent something and e nor dey relevant (if na anything, de baker wey dey for old Athens for fit predict de behavior of e fellowman *e go do am well and e go do am with better confidence* pass de people wey dey do am nowadays!). However, all dose things wey dem talk wey concern economics like all dose ones wey dem mention for up na clear thing say e nor dey meaningless and e nor still dey irrelevant. Na true say if we dey look all de implications wey self-serving positivism for dose people wey dey power., dem fit suspect am well say dem go fit accept positivism even tho say nor be true, and e go fit still fit continue even tho say dem show say na lie – as e don dey like dat sef.

All de three talk wey concern positivism wey relate with each other na lie.[^22]

[^22]: Look all dese things, Mises, *The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science*; Murray N. Rothbard, *Individualism and the Philosophy of the Social Sciences* (San Francisco: Cato, 1979); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Praxeology and Economic Science* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988); idem, “On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology and Ethics”; also Martin Hollis and Edward Nell, *Rational Economic Man* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), Introduction.

If e concern de way wey positivism tey classify well well de analytic, empirical, and emotive talk dem, person suppose ask: wetin go com be de state of dis axiom wey we dey talk? E go either be talk wey dey analytical or empirical, or e go be emotions wey dem dey show. If dem take am say e dey analytical, dem na talk wey be say dey empty, wey nor dey talk better thing of wetin dey real, but e just dey only define one kain sound or symbol with another one. Derefor, e go just raise e shoulder and talk say “ehen?” And dis kain answer go still dey nice if dem dey take de argument wey positivist dey talk say de talk still dey empirical. If na dat one be de case, dem go agree say dat kind talk fit still nor correct and say person go get right to tey know wetin really dey wey e go fit decide whether e dey or e nor dey. If we wan really talk am well,  as na talk wey dey empirical, e go fit just dey talk fact wey don dey history and so e nor go dey relevant if we wan determine whether e dey possible or e nor dey possible to tey bring out talk wey dey empirical and wey still be true, or normative and e nor go still carry emotions. Last last,if we dey  assume de way wey positivist tey dey reason say na propostion wey carry emotions, den according to dere own doctrine, common sense show say e nor get meaning and e nor get anything wey be true at all, and no need for person to pay attention to am like dog wey dey bark.

Derefor, person go need conclude from de beginning say positivism don fail patapata. E nor dey prove say ethics fit dey rational. And dem nor fit still consider am say na epistemology, or theory wey concern knowledge wey dey justifiable. Becox if e be like dat, den de main thing wey positivism dey talk go need to be talk wey be synthetic a priori (e go com be empirical and dem nor go fit talk say na lie), wey e existence, positivism nor gree. Derefor person go don see eself for rationalism wey dey social.


Similarly, positivism’s claim that all scientific explanations are hypothetical is self-defeating. (For what is the status of this explanation?)[^23] In order to see this, let it be assumed that an explanation relating two or more events has been found to fit one set of data, and that it is then applied to a second data set, presumably to undergo further empirical testing. Now one must ask: What is the presupposition which must be made in order to relate the second experience to the first one as either confirming or falsifying it? It might seem that if in the second instance of experience the observations of the first were repeated this would be a confirmation, and if not, a falsification. Clearly, the positivist methodology assumes this to be obvious. But this is not true. Experience only reveals that two or more observations regarding the temporal sequence of two or more types of events can be “neutrally” classified as “repetition” or “nonrepetition.” A neutral repetition only becomes a “positive” confirmation and a nonrepetition a “negative” falsification if independent of what can actually be discovered by experience, it is assumed that there are constant, time-invariantly operating causes. If, contrary to this, it is assumed that causes in the course of time might operate sometimes this way and sometimes that way, then these repetitive or nonrepetitive occurrences simply are and remain neutrally registered experiences, completely independent of one another. They are not in any way logically related to each other as confirming or falsifying one another. There is one experience and there is another, they are the same or they are different, but that is all there is to it; nothing else follows.

[^23]: See on the following also Hoppe, *Kritik der kausalwissenschaftlichen Sozialforschung*; see also supra chap. 7.

Thus, the presupposition of being able to say “falsify” or “confirm” is the constancy principle: the conviction that observable phenomena are in principle determined by causes that are constant and time-invariant in the way they operate. Only if the constancy principle is assumed to be valid does it follow from any failure to reproduce a result that there is something wrong with an original hypothesis; and only then can a successful reproduction indeed be interpreted as a confirmation. Obviously, this constancy principle is not itself based on or derived from experience. There is not only no observable link connecting events, but even if such a link existed, experience could not reveal whether or not it was time-invariant. The principle cannot be disproved by experience either, since any event which might appear to disprove it (such as a failure to duplicate some result) could be interpreted from the outset as if experience had shown here merely that one *particular* type of event was not the cause of another. However, to the extent that experience cannot exclude the possibility that *another* set of events might actually be found which would turn out to be time-invariant in its way of operating, the validity of the constancy principle cannot be disproved.

Nonetheless, although neither derived from nor disprovable by experience, the constancy principle is nothing less than the logically necessary presupposition for experiences which can be regarded as either confirming or falsifying each other (in contrast to isolated, logically unconnected experiences). Hence, since positivism assumes the existence of such logically related experiences, it must be concluded that it also assumes the existence of nonhypothetical knowledge about reality. It must assume that there are indeed time-invariantly operating causes, and it must assume this to be the case although experience could never possibly prove or disprove it. Once again, positivism turns out to be an inconsistent, contradictory philosophy. There exist nonhypothetical explanations of real things.

Finally (and by now not surprisingly), the positivist thesis of the unity of science turns out to be self-contradictory. Positivism claims that actions, just as any other phenomenon, can and must be explained by means of hypotheses which can be confirmed or refuted by experience. If this were the case, then—contrary to its own doctrine that there can be no a priori knowledge about reality—positivism would be forced to assume that with respect to actions time-invariantly operating causes exist. In order to proceed as positivism wants us to proceed—to relate different experiences regarding sequences of events as either confirming or falsifying each other—a constancy over time in the operation of causes must be presupposed (as has already been explained). However, if this were true and actions could indeed be conceived of as governed by time-invariantly operating causes, what about explaining the explainers, i.e., those who carry on the very process of hypothesis creation, of verification and falsification; all of us, that is, who act the way the positivists tell us to act? Evidently, to do all this—to assimilate confirming or falsifying experiences, to replace old hypotheses with new ones—one must assumedly be able to learn. However, if one can learn from experience, and the positivist is compelled to admit this, then one cannot know at any given time what one will know at later times and how one will act based on this knowledge. Rather, one can only reconstruct the causes of one’s actions after the event, since one can only explain one’s knowledge after one already possesses it. Thus, the positivist methodology applied to the field of knowledge and action, which contains knowledge as its necessary ingredient, is simply contradictory—a logical absurdity.

The constancy principle can and indeed must be assumed within the sphere of natural objects, i.e., for phenomena that are *not* constituted by one’s own knowledge or actions manifesting that knowledge (in this sphere the question of whether there are law-governed constants on the basis of which it becomes possible to make *exante* predictions is positively determined independent of experience, and empirical factors play a role only in determining which concrete variables are causally linked to which concrete effect variables, and which are not). With respect to knowledge and action, on the other hand, the constancy principle cannot be valid (in this sphere of phenomena, the question of whether or not there are constants is itself empirical in nature and can only be decided for a given variable on the basis of past experience, that is, *ex post*). And all this, which is definitely knowledge about something real, can be known apodictically. Hence, a methodological *dualism* rather than the positivist monism must be accepted and admitted as absolutely a priori true.
